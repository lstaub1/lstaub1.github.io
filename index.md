### GES 486
[Project 1: SAV Density Spatial & Temporal Analysis in the Chesapeake Bay](/projects/project1_486/README.md)
A Time series displaying the density changes in Submerged Aquatic Vegetation in the Chesapeake Bay from 1984 to 2018. 

## SAV Density change in the Chesapeake Bay over the course of 34 years

Submerged Aquatic Vegetation or SAV's are underwater grasses that grow in the shallow waters of the Chesapeake Bay. They are a very important aspect of the Chesapeake Bay and a strong indicator of it's overall health. Many quatic species including Maryland's beloved blue crab rely on SAV's for shelter and mating throughout their lifetime. 

According to the Chesapeake Bay Program, SAV's add oxygen to the water, improve water quality, provide food & shelter to wildlife, and reduce shoreline erosion. These grasses absorb excess nutrients and trap suspended sediment to help improve water quality but are extremely sensitive to pollution. Thankfully, SAV's are great at bouncing back when improvements to water quality are made. 

SAV's have been mapped since 1984 and restoration efforts were put into place in 2014 when the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement was enacted. The ultimate goal of these efforts is to have 90,000 acres of underwater grasses by 2017 and 130,000 acres by 2025.
