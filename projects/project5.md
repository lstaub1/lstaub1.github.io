## Project 4: Northern Cardinal Studies

**Project description:** This Project was mentored by Ohad Paris, M.S. and Colin Studds, Ph.D under the Animal Movement Lab and Geography and Environmental Systems (GES) Department at UMBC with a purpose of studying the effect of food availability on winter movements and subsequent reproductive success of a resident songbird on urban forest sites. 

Northern Cardinals were tracked during the winter using GPS and radio techniques. Experimental subjects were fed using RFID selective technology and the effects of reproductive success were observed during the breeding season.
