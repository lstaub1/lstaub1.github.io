## Project 6: Comparing Tweets in the United States During the Corona Virus Outbreak

**Project description:** This project compares the number of tweets per capita about the corona virus to the number of tweets per capita about toilet paper. During this pandemic in the United States, I personally see more social media posts about toilet paper than I do about the virus itself, so I began to wonder if this was the same across the US. Starting with 8,395 tweets about Covid-19 and 7,761 tweets about toilet paper, I was able to relate these tweets to the population of each state so that they could equally be compared. These tweets were collected with the package 'rtweets' in R studio. The state census data was collected in R studio as well, but with the packages 'tidycensus', 'tidyverse', and 'tigris'. 

The results of this map show that toilet paper is of much more concern in Calirfornia and Texas, but overall the US is tweeting about both topics equally. New York tweets more about Covid-19, which makes sense because currently it has the highest number of cases in the US.
