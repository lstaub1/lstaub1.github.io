## Project 3: Assessing the Changes in Chesapeake Bay Landcover

**Project description:** This Project was created in GES 381 by Kimberly Brackett, Ari Cacic, Bradley Weiss, and Leah Staub to assess the changes in landcover in the Chesapeake Bay. Landcover maps, confusion matrices, and pie charts were all created to compare the findings of landcover change for the years 1985, 2000 and 2015 to the Bay Health report of those same years. 


### Landsat 4-5 imagery was used for the year 1985, landsat 7 imagery was used for the year 2000, and landsat 8 imagery was used for the year 2015. Landcover maps were created in ENVI and saved as TIF files, while the confusion matrices and pie charts were created in excel.
