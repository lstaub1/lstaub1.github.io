## Project 4: Assessing Land Cover Changes in Kent Island Maryland

**Project description:** This Project was created in GES 481 to assess the changes in seasonal land cover type in Kent Island, Maryland for the year 2019. Landcover maps, class statistics and pie charts were all created to compare the findings of landcover change over the course of a year. 

False color Landsat 8 imagery was used in ENVI Classic and ENVI 5.5 to create the maps as well as extract the class statistics. Excel was used to create the pie graphs for a better visualization of the data.
