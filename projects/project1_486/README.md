Benthic Habitat types

I need to classify the benthic habitat types as well as find water quality data. I am also interested in finding how close shipping routes get to the oyster sanctuaries in the Bay- this might be the turn this project takes. 

I'm interested in finding what percent of each benthic habitat type is within each sanctuary, as well as what the water quality surrounding the sanctuaries is. 

An interactive map may be a nice option to see these results.
