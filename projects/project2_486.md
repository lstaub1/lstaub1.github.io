## Bigfoot Sightings in the USA

**Project description:** This project takes a look at bigfoot data compiled from the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization (BFRO). The aim of this project is to find relationships between bigfoot sighting locations and other factors. Two factors I especially would like to compare bigfoot locations to are temperature and proximity to National Parks.

A separate goal of this project is to explore the ggplot2 package in R and learned how to modify basemaps and create a visually pleasing product to display data.

Some of the quick maps I've made so far are below:
