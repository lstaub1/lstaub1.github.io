## Bigfoot Sightings in the USA

**Project description:** This project takes a look at bigfoot data compiled from the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization (BFRO). The aim of this project is to find relationships between bigfoot sighting locations and other factors. I wanted to use this data to learn how to use common tools in R like ggplot2 and ggmap- these two tools will be very helpful when displaying spatial data in the future. 

Find the data here: https://data.world/timothyrenner/bfro-sightings-data

Some of the quick maps I've made so far are below:

## Bigfoot Habitat in the USA

**Project description:** This project uses bigfoot data compiled from the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization (BFRO) and other factors to create a map that displays suitable habitat for bigfoot in the US. The other factors used include: Vegetation, Elevation, Precipitation, and Temperature.

The Point Sampling Tool Plugin was used in Q to do this analysis. A great tutorial on how to use it is linked below:
https://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/sampling_raster_data.html

This tool allowed me to see which values of each raster had the most bigfoot sightings.
